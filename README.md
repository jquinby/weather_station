# weather_station
An ongoing arduino weather station work-in-progress.

So far just the sketch, which uses a Bosch BME280 sensor for temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity. The final design will have a more robust temperature sensor, suitable for outdoor use. I also want to add an anemometer and wind vane, and have been loking at various designs for both. 

Obviously, some sort of connectivity is also needed. I intend to add the WiFi shield next. Most of the sketch has been cribbed from various tutorials or how-tos.
